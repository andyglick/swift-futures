/// A mutually exclusive (or mutex) lock.
///
/// A mutex is a type of semaphore that grants access to only one thread at a
/// time. If a mutex is in use and another thread tries to acquire it, that
/// thread blocks until the mutex is released by its original holder. If
/// multiple threads compete for the same mutex, only one at a time is allowed
/// access to it.
///
/// You instantiate a re-entrant variant by passing `true` to `init(recursive:)`.
/// A recursive lock may be acquired multiple times by the same thread without
/// causing a deadlock, a situation where a thread is permanently blocked waiting
/// for itself to relinquish a lock. While the locking thread has one or more
/// locks, all other threads are prevented from accessing the code protected by
/// the lock.
///
/// Both types of locks check for usage errors. See `PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK`
/// and `PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE` in `man 3 pthread_mutexattr_settype`.
///
/// Backed by `pthread_mutex`.
