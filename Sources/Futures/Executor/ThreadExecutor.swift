/// An executor that polls futures on the current thread.
///
/// `ThreadExecutor` is typically used to execute futures synchronously. Use
/// `wait()` to run the executor until all submitted futures complete or
/// `runUntil(_:)` to run until a given future completes. Both methods block
/// the current thread when no more progress can be made.
///
/// `ThreadExecutor` can also be used to integrate Futures with other
/// asynchronous systems. For example, each worker thread in a thread pool
/// could maintain a private `ThreadExecutor` instance and run it on every
/// tick using `run()`. This method does not block the current thread.
/// Instead, the executor runs until all possible progress is made and then
/// returns.
///
/// `ThreadExecutor` can optionally be initialized with limited capacity;
/// that is, it may be configured to have an upper bound on the number of
/// futures it tracks. Submitting a future that would result in the executor
/// exceeding capacity throws an error. You are encouraged to choose an
/// appropriate capacity for each use case, in order for the executor to
/// provide backpressure and limit memory usage or reduce latency. The executor
/// efficiently tracks its futures regardless of configured capacity; that is,
/// during each run it only polls futures that have signalled that they can
/// make progress.
///
/// Each thread automatically gets an unbounded `ThreadExecutor` instance that
/// is accessed via the `current` static property. Instances are lazily created
/// on first access and are stored in a thread local via `pthreads`. Note that
/// your code must still ensure it regularly calls `run()` or one of the `wait`
/// methods to run the executor.
///
/// `ThreadExecutor` is safe to use from one thread only, which is typically
/// the thread that created the instance. Submitting futures into the executor
/// or running the executor from multiple threads concurrently is undefined
/// behavior and will most likely result in a crash. The executor, however,
/// can handle concurrent wakeups from any number of threads.
