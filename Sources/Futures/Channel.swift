import FuturesSync

/// A protocol that defines primitives for unidirectional communication
/// between a *sender* and a *receiver* task. The sending side of a channel is
/// convertible to a sink and the receiving to a stream.
///
/// Channels are categorized into different *flavors* based on whether they
/// support a single or multiple senders and whether they apply backpressure
/// when their internal buffer reaches a configurable limit.
///
/// Channels can be explicitly closed by either the sending or receiving side.
/// Dropping either side causes the channel to close automatically. Senders
/// are prevented from sending new items into a closed channel. Any items
/// buffered by the channel, however, can still be taken out by the receiver.
///
/// Senders can request to be notified when the channel is flushed. Flushing
/// is not an exclusive operation; other senders are not prevented from
/// sending an item, or even closing the channel. Therefore flushing is useful
/// primarily with single-sender channels. Flushing multi-sender channels is
/// less reliable because of the indeterminism inherent in that configuration
/// -- a sender may request a flush and by the time it returns to check that
/// flushing completed another sender running on another thread might have
/// sent a new item. You have to externally coordinate the senders in this case.
